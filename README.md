## Overview

Qallupilluk is a humanoid creature from Inuit folklore that lives under the ice and in cold Arctic waters. Described as having greenish skin, long dark hair, and sometimes scales, the Qallupilluk lurks beneath the ice waiting for children who disobey their parents and wander too close to water's edge.

It hums to lure children closer, then snatches them and carries them away in its amauti (the pouch of a traditional Inuit parka used to carry babies). This creature serves as a cautionary tale to keep Inuit children away from the very real dangers of ice edges and open water in the Arctic, where falling through ice can be fatal.
