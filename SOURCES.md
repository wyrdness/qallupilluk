## Cultural Sensitivity Statement

This documentation is based on publicly available sources about Inuit traditional teaching stories. We recognize that Inuit oral traditions are the intellectual and cultural property of Inuit peoples, and that stories like Qallupilluk serve important functions in child-rearing and safety education.

Qallupilluk is not merely folklore or entertainment—it is a functional teaching tool that addresses real and serious dangers to children in Arctic environments. Researchers and readers should:

- Consult with Inuit communities for proper cultural context
- Respect the practical safety function of this tradition
- Avoid trivializing or sensationalizing
- Recognize this as living cultural practice
- Follow OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
